# Customer Churn Prediction  

This project is created as part of my revision for machine learning concepts. The goal is to predict customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It contains customer information such as account details, and usage patterns, which will be used to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.  

## Notebook Overview  
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and key features.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.  
- **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict customer churn.  
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.  

This project serves as a hands-on practice to reinforce my understanding of machine learning workflows.
